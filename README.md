About Me

Cybersecurity practitioner building real-world offensive and defensive lab environments to simulate attacker behavior and develop detection capability.

Focused on:

• SOC Operations
• Threat Detection
• Incident Response
• Container Security
• System Hardening
• Detection Engineering

I build vulnerable systems, attack them, analyze compromise, and design defensive detection strategies.
